# Git-Github
Git and Github assignment wek 3
Git & Github I feel like I have been thrown in to a new world.  I really have not yet grasped what any 

of this means yet.  I feel like there are vocabulary words thrown at me that I have no idea what they are 

or what function they might provide.  I do know that Git is not Github. Github is a website for hosting 

projects that use git.   Git is a type of version control system that makes it easier to track changes to 

files. I do understand when you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly what changed, who 

changed it and why they changed it.  Its also good for people , a team working together on a project. 

They can track progress and save the work.  I have tried using it to write a blog or an essay like this one 

to track my progress and changes.  Git is not the only version control system out there but they say its 

by far the most popular.  I know that I am trying to learn and understand Git and Github so I can use it 

as a building block and keep climbing up from there.  

I think if I tried to explain this to someone I would have them going in circles.  The best analogy I can give at this point is Git is a storage container and Github is a way to create all your files and imput important documents , update and add information as you learn more.
